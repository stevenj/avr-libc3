   avr/delay.h - loops for small accurate delays

#ifndef _AVR_DELAY_H_

#include <inttypes.h>

/** \defgroup avr_delay Busy-wait delay loops
    \code
    #define F_CPU 1000000UL  // 1 MHz
    //#define F_CPU 14.7456E6
    #include <avr/delay.h>
    \endcode

    \note As an alternative method, it is possible to pass the
    F_CPU macro down to the compiler from the Makefile.
    Obviously, in that case, no \c \#define statement should be
    used.

    The functions in this header file implement simple delay loops
    that perform a busy-waiting.  They are typically used to
    facilitate short delays in the program execution.  They are
    implemented as count-down loops with a well-known CPU cycle
    count per loop iteration.  As such, no other processing can
    occur simultaneously.  It should be kept in mind that the
    functions described here do not disable interrupts.

    In general, for long delays, the use of hardware timers is
    much preferrable, as they free the CPU, and allow for
    concurrent processing of other events while the timer is
    running.  However, in particular for very short delays, the
    overhead of setting up a hardware timer is too much compared
    to the overall delay time.

    Two inline functions are provided for the actual delay algorithms.

    Two wrapper functions allow the specification of microsecond, and
    millisecond delays directly, using the application-supplied macro
    F_CPU as the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz).  These functions
    operate on double typed arguments, however when optimization is
    turned on, the entire floating-point calculation will be done at
    compile-time.

    \note When using _delay_us() and _delay_ms(), the expressions
    passed as arguments to these functions shall be compile-time
    constants, otherwise the floating-point calculations to setup the
    loops will be done at run-time, thereby drastically increasing
    both the resulting code size, as well as the time required to
    setup the loops.
