	* configure.ac: bump version to release avr-libc 1.4.8.

2008-01-28  Joerg Wunsch <j.gnu@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	bug #22153: setjmp.o is wrong in libc.a (1.6.1) for avr's with SPH
	* include/avr/common.h: Enable default SPL/SPH definitions not
	when __COMPILING_AVR_LIBC__ is active; interestingly, the comment
	on the #endif had already been correct but the condition hadn't.
	While being here, protect default definition for EIND on avr6
	architectures to just avr-libc compilations (otherwise, it's
	supposed to come from the real device header).
